# Asset Administration Registry Server

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  

It is based on [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and logs shell or submodel registration-updates. The storage implementation is missing. You can either use the inMemory implementation or elastisearch implementation provided by sibling projects or implement your own storage.

Use the base-model project if you want to use just POJOs generated out of the OpenAPI description. You can also generate or implement your own model classes with specific annotations as we do it for the elasticsearch-storage implementation.
